# Google Sheets Integration Implementation

We've successfully implemented the Google Sheets integration as described in `SIMPLE_SETUP.md`. Here's what we've done:

## 1. Created Google Sheets API Integration

- Created `googleSheetsApi.ts` to fetch data from Google Sheets
- Implemented industry detection based on company name/website
- Added fallback to mock data if API key is not configured

## 2. Updated Data Model

- Added `industry` and `status` fields to the `Lead` type
- Added industry and status breakdown to the dashboard stats

## 3. Created Data Provider Context

- Created `LeadDataContext.tsx` to manage lead data
- Implemented data fetching and caching
- Added status update functionality

## 4. Updated UI Components

- Modified `ModernLeadTable.tsx` to display industry and status
- Added status update dropdown menu
- Enhanced filtering to include new status options

## 5. Updated App Component

- Wrapped the app with `LeadDataProvider`
- Added loading and error states
- Updated all components to use the lead data context

## 6. Added Documentation

- Created README.md with setup instructions
- Added example .env configuration

## How to Use

1. Follow the instructions in SIMPLE_SETUP.md to set up your Google Sheet
2. Create a `.env.local` file with your API key and spreadsheet ID
3. Run the application

The dashboard will automatically:
- Load leads from your Google Sheet
- Calculate stats based on your data
- Allow you to update lead statuses
- Display industry breakdowns based on company names

If the Google Sheets API is not configured, the dashboard will fall back to using mock data.
